## Observations and Insights
Ramicane treatment data matches very closely with that of Capomulin
Capomulin tretment data shows strong correlation between weight and tumor volume is 0.84, which tells us that the higher the weight the greater the volume of the tumor.
The distribution of female or male mice in the study is quite even. i.e 49/51(female/male)

## Background

A new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

The company have the complete [data](Pymaceuticals/data) from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated with a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. 

This [pymaceuticals.ipynb](Pymaceuticals/pymaceuticals.ipynb) will generate all the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the study. It also provide the top-level summary of the study results.
